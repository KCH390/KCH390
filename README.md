- 👋 Hi, I’m @KCH390!

- 👀 I’m interested in using code to do heavy mathematics and physical modeling. I've never had any formal coding education (besides a brief introduction to        MATLAB in my early engineering courses). My Python and C/C++ skills are purely self-taught with help from books, source documentation, YouTube, Udemy, and      StackExchange. 

- 🌱 I’m currently studying chemical engineering, C++, and Python. I also use MATLAB on occasion. My profile picture is a MATLAB plot of some thermodynamic          process data that I gathered during experimentation!

- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate with anyone, but I’m not necessarily opposed to it. I’m here to practice coding in a public environment and display      some of my basic abilities. I use code frequently in specific non-disclosable scenarios, so the programs I'm uploading are a small fraction of my actual        experience.
