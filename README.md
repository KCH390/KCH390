- 👋 Hi, I’m @KCH390
- 👀 I’m interested in using code to do heavy mathematics and physical modeling. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying chemical engineering, C++, and Python. I also use MatLab on occasion. 
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate with anyone, but I’m not necessarily opposed to it. I’m here to practice coding in a public environment and display some of my basic abilities.
- 📫 How to reach me: Make a comment on one of my repositories!
